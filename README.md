# PhaseAnalyzer
C++ plugin built with the JUCE Framework to provide insight about the relative phase relationship of audio signals, built specifically to help audio engineers with drum overhead microphone placement.Â 

# Dependancies
In order to build the plugin for your specific platform you will need the Projucer and the JUCE Library which can be found at [https://www.juce.com/get-juce/download](https://www.juce.com/get-juce/download).

You can then open the .jucer file and then use the Projucer to generate an appropriate project file for your IDE. 

# More Info and Builds
